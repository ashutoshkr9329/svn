📝 **Description:**
The SVN Update Script (svn.py) is a Python-based tool designed to automate the execution of svn update commands across multiple projects. This script simplifies the process of updating checked-out repositories, saving time and effort for users managing multiple SVN projects.

🔧 **Installation:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script with  ```python svn.py``` command.

📚 **Usage:**
The script accepts a list of directories as arguments, each containing an SVN-based project. It then executes the svn update command within each directory.

⚠️ **Known Limitations:**
1. Currently supports only  ```svn update ``` commands.
2. Limited to projects residing in specified directories.

⚙️ **Future Enhancements:**
1. Add support for other SVN commands.
2. Implement automatic detection of project directories.
